      <p>An ancient weapon of bygone age, this sword has been passed down
         through the lineage of the Grae Kings in Aedmari. Never has the
         holder of Garethak been defeated in battle, though wielding it
         takes a heavy toll upon the bearer. With the usurper Rasaty Drothar
         claiming herself the Queen of the Clans, the King of Clan Grae may
         have need of Garethak soon enough.
