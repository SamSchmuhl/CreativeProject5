      <p>The ancient peoples inhabiting the Tshansa, the Devouring Sands,
         called themselves the Vitari. Little is known about their civilization,
         but it is thought they were skilled sorcerers and craftsmen, brought
         low by a terrible cataclysm. Yet rumor and prophecy say that that
         their death may not be permanent...

        <p>Since the Primordial Chaos, Falaxryt-Bened, the Stonesoul, has
           survived, weathering the destruction of every Ascension thus far.
           The Lithi, loyal followers of the Stonesoul, follow in its wake,
           obeying its every command. Within this new vaccuum of power,
           it remains to be seen whether or not they will make a move...
