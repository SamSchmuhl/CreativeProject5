      <h2>THE GODS HAVE FALLEN</h2><hr>
        <p>In the wake of the Crimson Council's tyranny, a burgeoning rebellion
           has surfaced in the heart of the Aedmari lands. An elite force dubbed "The
           Flame Pact" vowed to see the end of the Gods of the Third Ascension,
           and travelled to the very Dark of the Abyss to accomplish their task.
           Against the Gods themselves, the Flame Pact succeeded, and for the first
           time since the dawn of the world, Divine power resides in the hands of mortals.</p><hr>
